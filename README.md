# Django MoMo API 
This is a django package for the MTN MoMo API. It can be added to your current django-based application so as to interact with the MTN MoMo API in a much simpler way.

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/mwanjajoel/django-momoapi.svg?branch=develop) 



## Why we created the Django MoMo API Package
MTN Uganda released API documentation to their Mobile Money service and integrations for Python, NodeJS, PHP, Java etc have been created but at the time of writing, there is no django package and yet Django is a popular Python based web framework. 

## Installation
```
pip install django-momoapi 
```
## Development Setup
```
- Create .env file following the .env_example.
- Create a postgre database and its credentials to the .env file.

```
